# MH-Z19C-CO2-Sensor-as-traffic-light



Welcome to the CO2-Sensor.

I have created a sensor easy to use and low cost to measure the co2 concentration in the air. You can use it to find out when to ventilate. 
With a price of 30 â‚¬ everyone can build one to check the amount of aerosol, which correlates with the amount of Covid-19 in the air.
